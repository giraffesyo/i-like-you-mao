              Hello Ë∞ã <span>üê±</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              I have so much fun when we're going out. I really love to spend time with you. I
              look forward to waking up and being able to text you... I can't
              stop thinking about you. You have, in a short time, invaded my
              mind. I believe that you are really thoughtful and caring when you
              are thinking of me. You show it through the way you speak. I feel
              like when I'm with you I can really be myself, and that is
              something I appreciate so much that I cannot describe it in words.
              I really feel safe in the way you talk to me and treat me. I would
              like to find out more about how it could be with you and me. I
              want to know everything about you. I am asking you to take a
              chance.
            </p>
            <Typing.Delay ms={500} />I really like you
            <Typing.Delay ms={500} /> .
            <Typing.Delay ms={500} /> .
            <Typing.Delay ms={500} /> . Mao

            <Typing.Reset count={-1} delay={500} />
            <p>
              I'll give you my 100%, mind, heart, body, soul. If you will give
              me yours. <Typing.Delay ms={1000} />
              <Typing.Reset count={-1} delay={500} />
              Ë∞ã, will you be my girlfriend?
