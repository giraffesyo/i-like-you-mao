            <p>
              I have so much fun when we're going out. I really love to spend
              time with you. I look forward to waking up and being able to text
              you... I can't stop thinking about you. <Typing.Delay ms={400} />I
              have been falling asleep with your messages open every night,
              staring at your words. You have, in a short time, invaded my mind.{' '}
              <Typing.Delay ms={200} />I believe that you are really thoughtful
              and caring when you are thinking of me. You show it through the
              way you speak. I feel like when I'm with you I can really be
              myself, and that is something I appreciate so much that I cannot
              describe it in words. <Typing.Delay ms={200} /> I really feel safe
              in the way you talk to me and treat me. I love that we both like
              the same things and that you don't judge me for being a nerdy
              guy... In fact, you tell me that is one of the things you like
              about me. You're so accepting and in a genuine way. I feel that
              you are such a genuine person with so much love to give I really
              feel like I can trust you. I want you to feel that I accept you
              and make you feel safe. I want you to feel happy and have fun
              times! I want to go on road trips with you and see new places. Try
              new foods... Experience life together. I would like to find out
              more about how it could be with you and me. I want to know
              everything about you. I am asking you to take a chance.
            </p>
            <Typing.Delay ms={500} />I really like you
