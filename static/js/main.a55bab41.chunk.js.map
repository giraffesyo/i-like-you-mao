In fact, you\n              tell me that is one of the things you like about me. You're so\n              accepting and in a genuine way. I feel that you are such a genuine\n              person with so much love to give I really feel like I can trust\n              you. I want you to feel that I accept you and make you feel safe.\n              I want you to feel happy and have fun times! I want to go on road\n              trips with you and see new places. Try new foods... Experience\n              life together. I would like to find out more about how it could be\n              with you and me. I want to know everything about you.
